# Space Patterns

This repository contains:
- The slides that we used for expert interviews.
- A pdf version of the 116 formalised space requirements.
- FRET importable JSON file containing all of our 116 formalised space requirements. Plesae note that there are 122 FRETish requirements in this file because some natural language requirements needes multiple FRETish requirements for complete specification. For example, those using the Wait and Phases patterns.
